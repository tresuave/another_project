# Heads or Tails Game

This game is a state of the art heads or tails game created with minimal javascript knowledge. 
I created everything on the fly and ran into some problems along the way. Currently this game is functional as long as the users operate the game as directed. This is a 2 player gambling game. The objective is to reach 2000.

# How to play:
1. Users input their names and decide who goes first.
2. The first play chooses whether they will select heads or tails.
3. Afterwards they can enter their bet. Keep in mind the winning score is 2000, not above, so strategies must be developed to arrive exactly at this number.
4. They must remember and confirm their choice. Selecting *OK* for heads or *CANCEL* for tails.
5. The next player will go and repeat 2-4 until someone wins.

# Suggestions

Contact the developer for any suggestions or bug fixes. Also I'm looking for some people to collab with.
